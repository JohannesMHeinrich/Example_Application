Hiring Manager \\
DeepMind Technologies Limited\\

Dear Hiring Manager,\\

Inspired by ``DeepMind: The Podcast'' I vistited the company website and was excited to find an open position as Science Researcher. As a postdoctoral physicist with a passion for programming and automation, and a deep interest in AI, I find the nature of this position very appealing. I would hereby like to apply for this position.\\

After obtaining my diploma in theoretical condensed matter physics in 2013 I undertook an internship at the SGL Carbon research centre. Here I investigated instabilities in the Hall H\'{e}roult process for smelting aluminium, and, having gained experience in the industry, I continued my academic journey.

I was fortunate to receive a Marie Curie early stage researcher position as PhD student at the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, where my project was the foundation of a complex experiment to obtain a more accurate measurement of the proton to electron mass ratio. My responsibilities included designing and operating the experimental hardware, and developing control software to execute experimental sequences. As part of a Marie Curie network I contributed to various international conferences and participated in training schools, reporting on the status and prospects of the project.

In 2018 I joined the ion trapping group at Imperial College in order to implement a new experiment to investigate novel quantum gates. My approach to interfacing experimental hardware was quickly picked up by the research group, and we used it among other things to stabilize multiple lasers. Furthermore, I gained experience in supervision of postgraduate students, co-supervising a masters project to interface a high-resolution camera for individual ion state detection.\\

My passion for automation and innovative technologies also expands to my private life, where I implement evolutionary algorithms to tackle different problems, and work with hardware such as the raspberry pi. I am also an avid board game player, and try to combine these interests in projects, like a webcam based dice reader for Settlers of Catan. 

I am fascinated by the impact advanced automation, robotics and artificial intelligence has on human society. This influence will only grow and I want to be part of it. General artificial intelligence has the potential to contribute to finding solutions to humanity's biggest challenges, and DeepMind is at the frontier of that development.

The position as Science Researcher offers an exciting possibility to join your company. With my diverse background in physics and my programming ability I am confident I will be able to quickly contribute towards the goals of DeepMind, while having the perfect conditions to develop as a scientist. Considering my private interests I am additionally convinced of being an ideal fit to the company culture.\\

As of November 2019 the new experiment at Imperial College demonstrated functionality, and I am looking for a new challenge in the field of automation, robotics and machine learning.\\

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,
